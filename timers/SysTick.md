## Steps to initialize SysTick Timer:
### 1. SysTick->LOAD must be set before enabling

This ensures that the timer starts counting from the correct value.

Load = (system frequency * delay_time) - 1;

* We need to substract 1 as 0 is included in the count.

Maximum delay = ((Max reload) + 1)/(clock freq);
* For a 24-bit timer, the max reload value is 0xFFFFFF
  - If we try to load more than that, it overflows and wonâ€™t work!
* With a system clock freq of 16MHz, the max delay is about 1.0486 seconds

### 2. SysTick->VAL should be cleared

Writing 0 to VAL resets the current counter to prevent unexpected behavior.

 ### 3. Enable SysTick in the control and status register

This ensures that the timer starts counting only after everything is properly configured.
* bit 0: timer enable
* bit 1: interrupt
* bit 2: clock source

Without the interrupt enabled, we need to manually check if the COUNT flag (bit 16) has been set after each cycle of the SysTick timer

## SysTick with polling:
* The difference between busy wait loops and SysTick with polling is the SysTick has accurate delays, but they both block CPU.

COUNTFLAG is set to 1 when the timer reloads from the RELOAD register back to its initial value (i.e., when it reaches zero).
* If COUNTFLAG = 1, it means the timer has counted down to zero.
* If COUNTFLAG = 0, it means the timer is still running.

  ### Example:
  Lets say we want the RED LED to stay on for 15 seconds and then after, the GREEN LED should turn on for 15 seconds.

  - set RED LED on
  - set SysTick timer for 15 s
  - check if timer is finished
      - while (timer still counting)
         { stay in this empty loop }
  - after timer finishes, loop exits
  - turn on GREEN LED
  - set SysTick timer for 15 s
  - check if timer is finished
      - while (timer still counting)
         { stay in this empty loop }
